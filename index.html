            Amazonic Rain Forest Mining Activity

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The Amazon rainforest plays a vital role not just to
                    South America but to the entire world. This amazing creation of
                    nature represents over half of the planet's remaining
                    rainforest and comprises one of the largest and most
                    biodiverse ecosystems in the world. However the gold mining
                    activity is destroying this ecosystem and is is needed to
                    present the data so that we can unerstand how critical this
                    situation has become .<br>
                    With this purpose, we are going to show the evolution of the
                    mining activity in the Peruvian Amazon forest. In the
                    last year, gold mining has destroyed almost <b id='value_counter_0'>
                        10000</b> hectares of rainforest in the Peruvian Amazon region,
                    almost the size of Paris of rainforest was destroyed. <br>
                    This activity is not only destroying the rainforest,
                    which is considered as the "lung of the world" because
                    of the key role it represents fighting the climate
                    change, but is also contaminating the soil and rivers
                    with toxic compounds that are used to extract and
                    processed the gold. <br>
                    This compounds are not only killing
                    both terrestrial and aquatic life, but also are dragged
                    by the rivers to nearest towns where high levels of
                    mercury have been detected.
                    There are two different
                    types of mining types in the Amazonia:
                    <mark class='hm_text'>
                        “Heavy Machinery“
                    </mark>
                    that uses big trucks and heavy machines to extract the
                    gold from the soil, and
                    <mark class='sp_text'>“Suction Pumps”</mark>
                    which is
                    composed of washers and more traditional methods to
                    extract the gold. We will analyze each one of this
                    methods and present them as a timeline and an
                    interactive visualization to show the effects that this
                    activity is causing.

                    The first record of gold mining at this region is in
                    1985, as you can see in the map it started with 73.9 ha

                    and Small Mines. At this time the sector with the
                    highest percentage of mining activity was :

                    see that the suction pump remains as the main method for
                    mining the gold. We have an increase of 161% for suction
