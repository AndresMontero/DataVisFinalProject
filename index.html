            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The Amazon rainforest plays a vital role not just to
                South America but to the entire world!. The Amazonia
                represents over half of the planet's remaining
                rainforest and comprises one of the largest and most
                biodiverse ecosystems in the world. If we want to have a
                future as a species and leave a better world to our
                children we need to take hands into action and present
                the data so that we can make a difference. With this
                purpose, we are going to show the evolution of the
                mining activity in the Peruvian Amazon forest. In the
                last year, gold mining has destroyed almost 10000
                hectares of rainforest in the Peruvian Amazon region,
                almost the size of Paris of rainforest was destroyed.
                This activity is not only destroying the rainforest,
                which is considered as the "lung of the world" because
                of the key role it represents fighting the climate
                change, but is also contaminating the soil and rivers
                with toxic compounds that are used to extract and
                processed the gold This compounds are not only killing
                both terrestrial and aquatic life, but also are dragged
                by the rivers to nearest towns where high levels of
                mercury have been detected. There are two different
                types of mining types in the Amazonia: “Heavy Machinery“
                that uses big trucks and heavy machines to extract the
                gold from the soil, and “Suction Pumps” which is
                composed of washers and more traditional methods to
                extract the gold. We will analyze each one of this
                methods and present them as a timeline and an
                interactive visualization to show the effects that this
                activity is causing.

            <h2>1985</h2>
            <p>
                The first record of gold mining at this region is in
                1985, as you can see in the map it started with 73.9 ha
                and distributed between the sectors : Huepetuhe, Delta
                and Small Mines. At this time the sector with the
                highest percentage of mining activity was :
                <b>Huepetuhe/Heavy Machinery with 35.73 ha.</b> The
                relation between the two different mining methods was
                <b>55% for Heavy Machinery </b> and 45% for Suction
                Pumps.

            <h2>1993</h2>
            <p>
                In the year 1993, we can observe an alarming increase in
                mining activity, with a total increase of <b>1036%</b>.
                The area of the mining activity was <b>839.5</b> ha
                distributed between the sectors: Huepetuhe, Delta and
                small mines. As you can observe the sector with the
                highest percentage remain as <b>Huepetuhe</b> with
                <b>695.6 ha</b> of Heavy Machinery mining, this method
                had the 83% of the total mining area at that time. This
                was the preferred method to extract gold at this time,
                which can be confirmed comparing the increase in
                percentage compared to the previous year with an
                incredible <b>1618%</b>.

            <p>
                The things remain almost the same in 2001 in terms of
                total area used for mining with an increase of
                <b>10%</b> with a total of 919.6 ha. <br/>However if we
                go deeper into the data we can see that we had an abrupt
                change between the preferred method to mine the gold
                <b>Suction Pumps</b> had a total of <b>77%</b> compared
                to just <b>17%</b> in the previous period. The total
                area of <b>Suction Pumps</b> was 708 ha. and an increase
                of 392%, mostly distributed on the sector of small
                mines. And the Heavy Machinery decreased by 70 % with a
                total of only 211.1 ha.

            <h2>2009</h2>
            <p>
                In 2009 the increase of mining activity compared to 1985
                was alarming, an increase of 151% over the area used for
                mining, a total of 2304.6 ha of the Peruvian Amazon
                rainforest was destroyed and contaminated because of the
                gold mining. The sectors where the mining was done:
                Huepetuhe, Delta, Pampa, and small mines. The sector
                with the highest percentage was :
                <b>Pampa with 962.47 ha of suction pumps mining.</b> The
                relation between the two different mining methods was
                20%-80% for heavy machinery and suction pumps. We can
                see that the suction pump remains as the main method for
                mining the gold. We have an increase of 161% for suction
                pumps with a total of 1846.1 ha and an increase of 117%
                for heavy machinery and a total of 458.4 ha

            <h2>2017</h2>
            <p>
                In 2017 things became critical, the gold mining activity
                had an increase of 328% compared to 2009, with an area
                of 9859.8 ha, almost the size of Paris of Peruvian
                Amazon rainforest was destroyed and contaminated. At
                this moment the activity was distributed over the
                sectors: Huepetuhe, Delta, Pampa, and small mines. The
                sector with the highest percentage of mining is
                <b> Small Mines with 4486.9 ha of Suction Pumps. </b>
                The relation between the two different mining methods
                was 34%-66% for heavy machinery and suction pumps. We
                can see that the suction pump is the main method for
                mining gold, with an increase of 252% and a total of
                6497.5 ha compared to an increase of 633% for heavy
                machinery and a total of 3362.3 ha.
