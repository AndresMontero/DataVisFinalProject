                    <h1>Amazonic Rain  Forest Mining Activity "Region of Peru"</h1>
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the last year gold mining has destroyed almost 10000 hectares of rainforest in the Peruvian amazon region, almost 10 times the size of Paris, this activity is not just destroying the rainforest of the region, but also contaminating the soil with the toxic compounds used to extract the gold from the soil, mainly mercury. There are two different types of mining types:  “Heavy Machinery“ that uses big trucks and latest to extract the gold from the soil, “Suction Pumps” composed of washers and more traditional methods to extract the gold.
                        We will analyze the data and presented as a timeline interactive graphic to show the effects that this activity is causing to the peruvian rainforest.
                        .<p>

                    <div id="chartContainer">
                        <h2>Increase of the area of mining in the amazonic rain forest by Type : Heavy Machinery and Suction Pumps.<br/>
                            During the period: January 1985&ndash;Januar 2017</h2>
                    </div>
                    <h2>1985</h2>
                    The first record of gold mining at this region is in 1985, as you can see in the map it started with 73.9 ha and distributed between the sectors : Huepetuhe, Delta and Small Mines.
                    At this time the sector with the highest percentage of mining activity was : <b>Huepetue/Heavy Machinery with 35.73 ha.</b>
                    The relation between the two different mining methods was 55% for Heavy Machinery and 45% for Suction Pumps.

                    <h2>1993</h2>
                    In 1993 there was an increase of 1036% for the mining activity of the region. A total of 839.5 ha distributed between the sectors : Huepetuhe, Delta and small mines.
                    As you can observe the sector with the highest percentage remain as <b>Huepetue with 644.13 ha of Heavy Machinery mining.</b>
                    The relation between the two different mining methods was 83% for Heavy machinery and 17% for Suction pumps, we can see that the Heavy Machinery was the dominating method to extract the gold with an increase of 1618% and a total of 695.6 ha.

                    <h2>2001</h2>
                    In 2001 there was an increase of 10% between 1985. A total of 919.6 ha was used for the gold mining activity, at this point another sector was added to the region, the sector of : Pampa.
                    The sector with the highest percentage of gold mining activity is : <b>Small Mines with 620.63 ha of Suction Pumps mining.	</b>
                    The relation between the two different mining methods was 23% for Heavy Machinery and 77% for Suction Pumps, we can see an exceptional change compared to the previous year, with an abrupt
                    increase of the mines that use Suction Pumps, with a total of 708.5 ha and an increase of 392%. However the Heavy machinery  decreased -70% with a total of 211.1 ha.

                    <h2>2009</h2>
                    In 2009 the increase of mining activity compared to 1985 was alarming, an increase of 151% over the area used for mining, a total of 2304.6 ha of the peruvian amazon rainforest was destroyed and contaminated because of the gold mining.
                    The sectors where the mining was done : Huepetuhe, Delta, Pampa and small mines. The sector with the highest percentage was : <b>Pampa with 962.47 ha of suction pumps mining.</b>
                    The relation between the two different mining methods was 20%-80% for heavy machinery and suction pumps. We can see that the suction pump remain as the main method for mining the gold. We have an increase of 161% for suction pumps with a total of 1846.1 ha and an increase of 117% for heavy machinery and a total of 458.4 ha

                    <h2>2017</h2>
                    In 2017 things became critical, the gold mining activity had an increase of 328% compared to 2009, with an area of 9859.8 ha, almost  the size of Paris of peruvian amazon rainforest was destroyed and contaminated.
                    At this moment the activity was distributed over the sectors: Huepetuhe, Delta, Pampa and small mines. The sector with the highest percentage of mining is <b> Small Mines with 4486.9 ha of Suction Pumps. </b>
                    The relation between the two different mining methods was 34%-66% for heavy machinery and suction pumps. We can see that the suction pump is the main method for mining gold, with an increase of 252% and a total of 6497.5 ha compared to an increase of 633% for heavy machinery and a total of 3362.3 ha.
